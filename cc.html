      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <img src="img/searchbar.png" />
      <p>I participated in the <a href="https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/">2020 Congressional App Challenge</a>. It is a nation wide event and I competed within my state district. What I developed is a flask app that determines how reputable a charity is by considering data about that charity found on the web.</p>
    <div id="cchecker">
      <h2>What does it do?</h2>
      <p>It looks on the IRS site to find out if it is an establish non-profit organization, to see if the charity can be exempt from federal tax income, and to pull the charity's legality data. The program also looks for the chairty's data on charitynavigator.org, that is where professional ratings and critical information such as after costs can be observed. Along with that, Charity Checker supplies the latest news articles about the charity, and gives it's own rating based upon the data it found about it from the web.</p>
    <div id="cchecker">
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <img src="img/results.png" />
      <p>The text editor I used to develop my app was python. The front end is written in HTML/CSS and the back end is written in Python. </p>
