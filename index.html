        <h2>Scratch Quest Game</h2>
        <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/335726193">Quest Game</a></p>
        <p>This is my quest game. It is my final CS First project for Introduction to Programming and Robotics, and it involves a character set out to find gold. You can control the character using the arrow keys, and must journey throughout the land to find the gold. I learned how to broadcast messages within the code while i was making this project. For some reason, the house, the cave, and the forest did not reappear when the character returned to the town, even after the code received messages telling it to make them appear. I fixed this by making them appear when the backdrop number equals their number. Add-Ons in this game are Peek-A-Boo and Obstacle Obstruction. This means the gold will only appear on the screen when close to it, and you wont be able to walk on trees, tables, logs, etc. Play by pressing the green flag...</p>

        <h2>CMU Python Group Picture</h2>
        <p><a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/violetFrog8929">CMU Collaborative Task</a></p>
        <p>This is a picture some friends and I made using python. The picture was a collaborative task in the CMU Python course that we were doing in AP Computer Science Principles. We coded shapes and labels in different sizes and colors to create this picture. The setting is 5 adolescent individuals camping outside of McDonalds in San Francisco to be the first ones to receive the new Travy Patty, but they are doing their favorite activites so they do not get bored. I designed the McDonalds building in the background, and the ping pong activity going on in the bottom right.</p>

        <p>Right here is my Thunkable app. Essentially it is a random number generator that I would work on during Genius Hour for AP Computer Science Principles. It is a very basic app because I just took the opportunity of Genius Hour to get a feel for Thunkable rather than focussing on a big project so in the future I could use Thunkable without a problem.</p>

        <p>I have also been working on an app for the Congressional App Challenge during Genius Hour. It is a flask app that is currently being developed using Python, HTML, and CSS. As of right now, it is a web based app that runs locally the device in which the program is ran on, but soon I will look into putting it onto a server when it is finished. More about this coming soon.</p>
